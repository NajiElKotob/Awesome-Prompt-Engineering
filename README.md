## Prompt Key Elements
* Clear Objective: Know the purpose of your prompt. Is it to elicit a narrative, gather information, prompt a creative response, or test knowledge?
* Specificity: Be as specific as possible to guide the response. Vague prompts can lead to off-topic responses.
* Context and Background: Include enough context so the respondent understands the situation or topic without needing external information.
* Clarity: The language should be straightforward and unambiguous to avoid confusion.
* Open-Ended Questions: For creative or analytical responses, open-ended questions can encourage more detailed and thoughtful replies.
* Guidelines and Constraints: Clearly outline any guidelines or constraints, such as word count, format, or the type of information you're seeking.
* Relevance and Interest: Make sure the prompt is relevant to the audience's interests and knowledge to keep them engaged.
* Flexibility: Allow for some level of interpretation or personal input so that the response can be personalized.
* Feedback Criteria: If the response will be evaluated, provide criteria for what constitutes a good response.
* Examples: Offering examples can clarify expectations and provide a model for the structure and depth of the desired response.
* Encouragement of Critical Thinking and Creativity: Especially in educational settings, prompts should encourage users to think critically and creatively.

## Core Prompt Key Elements
* Instructions – Likely detailing what is expected in the response to the prompt.
* Question – The specific query or topic that needs to be addressed in the response.
* Input data – This could refer to any data, information, or context necessary to accurately respond to the question.
* Examples – Possibly providing examples or guidance on how to structure the response or what kind of content might be appropriate.

## Techniques
* **Chain of thought prompting** is an approach used primarily with AI language models and other advanced computational systems. It involves crafting prompts that encourage the system to demonstrate its reasoning process step by step, as if it were "thinking out loud." The goal is to make the AI's decision-making transparent and to follow a logical progression that leads to an answer.
