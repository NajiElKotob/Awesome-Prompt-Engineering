# Awesome Prompt Engineering
{Awesome Works in Progress}

`Designing a good prompt is like giving clear instructions to a very smart assistant.
The clearer and more structured you are, the better the output you receive.`

## Prompt Key Elements
* **Clear Objective**: Know the purpose of your prompt. Is it to elicit a narrative, gather information, prompt a creative response, or test knowledge?
* **Specificity**: Be as specific as possible to guide the response. Vague prompts can lead to off-topic responses.
* **Context and Background**: Include enough context so the respondent understands the situation or topic without needing external information.
* **Clarity**: The language should be straightforward and unambiguous to avoid confusion.
* **Open-Ended Questions**: For creative or analytical responses, open-ended questions can encourage more detailed and thoughtful replies.
* **Guidelines and Constraints**: Clearly outline any guidelines or constraints, such as word count, format, or the type of information you're seeking.
* **Relevance and Interest**: Make sure the prompt is relevant to the audience's interests and knowledge to keep them engaged.
* **Flexibility**: Allow for some level of interpretation or personal input so that the response can be personalized.
* **Feedback Criteria**: If the response will be evaluated, provide criteria for what constitutes a good response.
* **Examples**: Offering examples can clarify expectations and provide a model for the structure and depth of the desired response.
* **Encouragement of Critical Thinking and Creativity**: Especially in educational settings, prompts should encourage users to think critically and creatively.

### Set the Role (Optional but Powerful)
* Assigning a role helps the model understand how to behave and what tone to adopt.
* `Example: You are a senior data analyst specializing in Power BI and data visualization.`
