## Prompt Key Elements
* Clear Objective: Know the purpose of your prompt. Is it to elicit a narrative, gather information, prompt a creative response, or test knowledge?
* Specificity: Be as specific as possible to guide the response. Vague prompts can lead to off-topic responses.
* Context and Background: Include enough context so the respondent understands the situation or topic without needing external information.
* Clarity: The language should be straightforward and unambiguous to avoid confusion.
* Open-Ended Questions: For creative or analytical responses, open-ended questions can encourage more detailed and thoughtful replies.
* Guidelines and Constraints: Clearly outline any guidelines or constraints, such as word count, format, or the type of information you're seeking.
* Relevance and Interest: Make sure the prompt is relevant to the audience's interests and knowledge to keep them engaged.
* Flexibility: Allow for some level of interpretation or personal input so that the response can be personalized.
* Feedback Criteria: If the response will be evaluated, provide criteria for what constitutes a good response.
* Examples: Offering examples can clarify expectations and provide a model for the structure and depth of the desired response.
* Encouragement of Critical Thinking and Creativity: Especially in educational settings, prompts should encourage users to think critically and creatively.
